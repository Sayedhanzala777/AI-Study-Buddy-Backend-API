AI-Study-Buddy-Backend-API

AI-Study-Buddy-Backend-API is a Node.js and Express based backend designed to power an AI-driven study assistant. This API allows users to manage their study materials while leveraging AI-powered tools to improve learning efficiency. It’s designed for easy integration with web or mobile frontends.

Key Features

User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and have secure access to their personal data using JWT-based authentication.

Note Management: Users can create, read, update, and delete study notes. Notes are linked to individual users for personalized management.

AI-Powered Study Tools: The backend can process notes and provide:

Summaries: AI-generated concise summaries of study notes.

Quizzes: Automatic question generation based on note content.

Flashcards: AI-generated flashcards for quick learning and memorization.

Technologies Used

Node.js: Server-side runtime for building scalable backend services.

Express.js: Framework to handle routing, middleware, and API endpoints efficiently.

MongoDB: NoSQL database to store user data, notes, and AI-generated content.

Mongoose: ODM library to interact with MongoDB easily.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Secures API endpoints and manages user sessions.

bcryptjs: Password hashing for secure user authentication.

Cors: Enables frontend apps hosted on different domains to access the API.

dotenv: Manages environment variables like database URIs and secrets.

OpenAI API (optional, for AI features): Generates summaries, quizzes, and flashcards dynamically from notes.

Why These Technologies

Node.js + Express allows for fast, lightweight, and asynchronous server operations, ideal for handling multiple users and AI requests simultaneously.

MongoDB provides flexible, schema-less storage for dynamic study content and AI-generated data.

JWT ensures secure, stateless authentication without the need for server-side session storage.

OpenAI API makes it possible to give intelligent, automated study assistance without building AI models from scratch.

Who It’s For

This backend is perfect for anyone building a study app, educational platform, or AI learning tool, providing a foundation to integrate intelligent study features with a secure and scalable backend.
